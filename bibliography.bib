abstract="Teaching introductory computing courses with Scheme elevates the intellectual level of the course and thus makes the subject more appealing to students with scientific interests. Unfortunately, the poor quality of the available programming environments negates many of the pedagogic advantages. To overcome this problem, we have developed DrScheme, a comprehensive programming environment for Scheme. It fully integrates a graphics-enriched editor, a multi-lingual parser that can process a hierarchy of syntactically restrictive variants of Scheme, a functional read-eval-print loop, and an algebraically sensible printer. The environment catches the typical syntactic mistakes of beginners and pinpoints the exact source location of run-time exceptions.",

The traditional batch style of programming, edit -{\ensuremath{>}} compile -{\ensuremath{>}} run, is slowly being reevaluated by the development community at large.  Languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby are at the heart of a new programming culture commonly described as extreme, agile or dynamic.  Musicians are also beginning to embrace these environments and to investigate the opportunity to use dynamic programming tools in live performance.  This paper provides an introduction to Impromptu, a new interactive development environment for musicians and sound artists.},
